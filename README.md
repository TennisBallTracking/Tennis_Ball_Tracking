# Soccer ball tracking
* The training and testing images, csv files, python scripts and trained model weights can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZ9RJTUu6pnPT3reZWfpe-v2BwfVdsDw/view?usp=sharing). The whole dataset is about 3.8GB.
* An example of automatic soccer ball tracking (the source video is 1280x720 25fps, we resize the tracking output video to 640x480 10fps to reduce the file size). The thick circle represents the center ball position, the thin circle represents twice the standard deviation:
